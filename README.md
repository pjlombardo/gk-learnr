Git Repository for LearnR lessons designed for a biology lab course, designed for and with Dr. Grace Kwan.

Lessons include:

* A lesson on how to run and interpret ANOVA in R: `anova`.
* A lesson on creating a specific visual for experimental data: `endpoint-plot`
* A lesson on creating a different visual for experimental data: `time-plot`

For those hosting these lessons on a shiny server, please note that the 
files must be *locally rendered* to create the .HTML-file before they will 
work.
