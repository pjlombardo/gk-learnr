## Understanding the experimental data
In this lesson, we will learn how to create an important plot for visualizing differences in a mean measurement across several groups.  In order to create the visual, we need to understand the underlying experiment.  The data, and the description below, were generously provided by Dr. Grace Kwan.

#### Background

*Enzymes typically have optimal pH at which they work best. Above or below this optimal pH, the enzyme’s activity diminishes. Organisms may need to regulate the pH of their environment in order to ensure that their enzymes function optimally.*

*Pectobacterium carotovorum is a commonly found bacterial pathogen that rots plant tissues. This bacterium uses enzymes to break down plant cell walls, causing the plant cells to burst from osmotic pressure and release all of their water and nutrients – nutrients that support the continued growth of the bacterial pathogen. We often see this as slimy, watery lesions that rapidly consume whole fruits or vegetables.*

*This experiment assessed the importance of environmental pH on the ability of P. carotovorum to rot plant tissues. The enzymes that break down plant cell walls require a slightly basic pH. To ensure a favorable environment, P. carotovorum uses the BudB protein to limit acid production during metabolism by providing an alternate fermentation pathway that results in a product of neutral pH.*

### Experiment details
The experiment monitored several lettuce leaves within each treatment class:

* Three control leaves without bacteria (`"Control"`)
* Nine leaves inoculated with wild-type P. carotovorum (`"wildtype"`), and
* Nine leaves inoculated with $\Delta$budB mutant (`"budB"`).

At 20, 50, and 100 hours, disease progression was monitored as the size of the soft rot area. At the conclusion of the experiment, 100 hrs, the soft rotted tissue was mashed up to evaluate the pH.


### Exploring the data
Recall from our video (INSERT LINK TO VIDEO!!!!) that our experiment data has been put in tidy format. Here is a link to a google sheet with the data for you to refresh your memory: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14SjsEqxfG1aucubCJkq41gMLh47XJ5b2R1J0PMAkar4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Sheet of Experiment Data.</a> Recall there are two sheets:

* **tidy**: This sheet has our data in its tidy format
* **original**: This sheet has our data in its original format.

We have loaded *the tidy version* of our data into R under the data frame name `experiment`.

***

<details>
<summary> $\blacktriangleright$ Review Code for Loading Data...</summary>
The code for loading data into `R` depends on the format of the file (`.xslx`, `.csv`, `.tsv`, et cetera).  For those interested, here is code for loading our experiment data in CSV and Excel formats
```
# CSV format
experiment <- read.csv("location/file.csv", 
                        header = T)
# Example:
experiment <- read.csv("data/experiment.csv",
                        header = T)

# Excel
library(readxl)
experiment <- read_excel("location/file.xlsx",
                        sheet="sheet_name")
# Example:
experiment <- read_excel("data/experiment.xlsx",
                        sheet="tidy")
```
When in doubt, you can always use the "Import Dataset" button in the upper-right Environment Tab of R Studio:
<center><img src="images/import.png" 
     width="375" 
     height="120"/></center>
</details>

***

Run the code block below to become familiar with the data and its format.  We store the information in the `experiment` data frame. Remember you can use "Next" button in the lower right to see more rows of the data.
```{r explore-p1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
experiment
```

```{r var-questions}
question("Which variables appear in our data frame? *Select all that apply.*",
    answer("Leaf_ID"),
    answer("pH", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Treatment", correct = TRUE),
    answer("TimeGroup", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Length_lesion"),
    answer("Final_pH"),
    allow_retry = T,
    random_answer_order = T,
    incorrect = paste(random_encouragement(),"Look at the column headings of the data frame after running the code above this question."),
    post_message = random_praise()
  )
```


```{r why-NA}

question_text(
  "In your own words, describe why the `pH` values are `NA` unless our time measurement equals \"100hr\".  Write a sentence before revealing the answer below.<br></br> *Ready to see an explanation?* (***Note***: all responses are marked as correct, so please compare your answer to ours!) <br></br> Submit your sentence to see an example written by us!",
  answer_fn(function(value) {
    if (grepl(".*", value)) {
      correct("Great work! How does your explanation compare with ours?")
    }
  }), message="The pH was not measured until the *end of the experiment*, so only when `TimeGroup` equals \"100hr\".  At \"20hr\" or \"50hr\", the measurement value is `NA` to indicate we did not take a measurement at those times."
)

```


### Great work so far!
Now that we are acquainted (or re-acquainted) with the data, we can turn to the task at hand.  We want to visualize the average `pH` of the lettuce leaves at the end of our experiment, but we want to break the leaves into groups by the `Treatment` variable.  In addition, we wish to have our visual convey a sense the variation we saw *within* each group. 

In the next section, we will present a common plot for accomplishing the goals above, and then spend the rest of the lesson learning how to make this plot using `dplyr` and `ggplot2` in R!

Ready to get started?

***

*Quick Remarks:* For those new to `ggplot2`, we recommend this brief lesson (LINK HERE!!!!).  There is also a nice lesson on summary tables using `dplyr` here (LINK HERE !!!!).


## Planning our plot
Your co-author asks whether you can build the following plot in `ggplot2`; she provides a quick, hand-drawn sketch:

<center><img src="images/plot2draw.jpg" alt="Co-author Plot Sketch" width="70%"></center>

To translate a plot into `ggplot()` code, we start by considering two questions:

1. What aesthetics, `aes()` will we need? 
2. What geometries, `geom_*()`, appear?

### Aesthetics
Getting started with the aesthetics is easiest because our axes will always be part of the aesthetics. Looking at how the axes are labeled, we can surmise:

* `x`: The $x$-axis aesthetic will be our `Treatment` variable, because our group classifications appear as the labels along the axis (`"wildtyp"`, `"budB"`, `"Control"`).
* `y`: The $y$-axis aesthetic is trickier.  Notice it is labeled with ***average*** `pH`.  Average pH is related to, *but not the same as* the `pH` measurement. 

> **Important Idea:** Because the `y` aesthetic reports the average (or mean) pH, we will need to use a data frame that has the average pH per group as a variable (or column).

We can do this by summarizing our `experiment` data frame, but before we jump to this let's continue planning our plot.

### Geometries
Notice that the "content" (loosely speaking, the drawing in the middle of the plot) consists of

* bars (or columns), which represent the average pH. (`geom_bar()` or `geom_col()`)
* error-bars, which give us a sense of the variation *within* the `Treatment` groups. (`geom_errorbar()`)

To correctly plot the `geom_errorbar()`, our data frame will have to include the following *aesthetics* for each group:

* `ymin`: the value for the lowest part of the error bar,
* `ymax`: the value for the upper part where the error bar stops.

<!-- To determine the start and stop values of the error-bars, we will use a (mean $\pm$ 2*std.dev) approach to determine these values.^[This is inspired by confidence intervals for the population mean based on a sample mean, but the results are unofficial.] -->

### Keep on going!
Hopefully, the recipe for constructing this plot is starting to take form.  In the remaining sections, we will

1. Prepare a data frame from `experiment` that has the information we need to create the plot; we'll call it `plot_df`.
2. Use `plot_df` to set up the axes and plot the columns;
3. Finish with the error-bars and add some finishing touches (like labels and titles). 

Ready to get plotting?




## Preparing a plotting data frame {data-progressive=TRUE}
Having surveyed the plot we want to build, we can now describe the data frame we would need to use for plotting.  Make sure each of the requirements below make sense to you!

1. Since we are dealing with `pH`, which was only measured at the end of the experiment, we only want to include rows where `TimeGroup` equals `"100hr"`. We will use the `filter()` function to accomplish this.
2. Because we want to display the average (mean) pH for each group, we will need find the mean pH for each treatment group. Hence, we will `group_by()` the `Treatment` variable and then `summarize()` to calculate the mean `pH`.
3. To create the error-bars in the plot, we need to add columns to the data frame which specify where the error bars will start and stop. The `mutate()` function allows us to add columns of new computations to the data frame. We will use the following formula to determine where the error-bars start and stop: `mean` $\pm$ `2*std.dev`.

<details>
<summary> $\blacktriangleright$ A note on the error-bar formula `mean` $\pm$ `2*std.dev`.</summary>
***

For this plotting exercise, we are using `mean` $\pm$ `2*std.dev` for our error-bar computation rather than the technical formula for a 95\% confidence interval.  This is simply for convenience, since using the simpler multiplier of 2, as opposed to a $t_{\alpha/2}$ critical value, will give a reasonable approximation of the 95\% confidence interval in most cases. Moreover, any differences between our estimate and the correct confidence interval would not be *visible* in the figure.

***
</details>

### Step 1: filtering
Recall that we only want rows where `TimeGroup` equals (`==`) the `"100hr"` mark.  Use the code chunk below, with the `filter` command, to do this and check your work by sifting through the data frame.
```{r filter, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
experiment %>%
    filter(...)
```
```{r filter-hint-1}
experiment %>%
    filter(TimeGroup ...)
```
```{r filter-hint-2}
experiment %>%
    filter(TimeGroup == "...")
```
```{r filter-solution}
experiment %>%
    filter(TimeGroup == "100hr")
```


### Step 2: summarizing by group
Now that we have filtered our data frame, we can begin making  the summary data frame that we need to create our plot (`plot_df`).  Since we want to compute summaries for each `Treatment` group, we need to

1. Take our `experiment` data frame and `group_by()` the `Treatment` variable, then
2. `summarize()` the appropriate variable (`pH`) using `R` functions

We first need the `mean()` function and the `sd()` function to compute the mean and standard deviation of the `pH` variable.

#### Exercise: summary statistics for pH
Build on the `dplyr` pipe that filters the data frame. Add the appropriate `group_by()` and `summarize()` code to create the summary measurements described above.  

Use the following names for these summary variables: `average.pH` and `stddev.pH`.

```{r group-by, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=6}
experiment %>% 
    filter(TimeGroup=="100hr") %>%
    group_by(...) %>%
    summarize(...)
```
```{r group-by-hint-1}
experiment %>% 
    filter(TimeGroup=="100hr") %>%
    group_by(Treatment) %>%
    summarize(...)
```
```{r group-by-hint-2}
experiment %>% 
    filter(TimeGroup=="100hr") %>%
    group_by(Treatment) %>%
    summarize(average.pH = ..., # write your computation
            stddev.pH = ...   # write your computation
             )
```
```{r group-by-solution}
experiment %>% 
    filter(TimeGroup=="100hr") %>%
    group_by(Treatment) %>%
    summarize(average.pH = mean(pH), # write your computation
            stddev.pH = sd(pH)   # write your computation
             )
```

### Step 3: adding variables for the error-bars
We are almost done preparing our data for the `ggplot()` we are designing. We still need to add information to the plotting data frame about where the error-bars start and stop.  Recall that `mutate(new_var = values)` will create new variables and add them to a data frame.  We want to add

* `low`: a value for the lower end of our error-bar, created by taking `average.pH - 2*stddev.pH`; and
* `high`: a value for the lower end of our error-bar, created by taking `average.pH + 2*stddev.pH`


#### Exercise: adding `low` and `high` variables to our summary table.
Fill in the `mutate()` code below, which we added to our work from the previous two sections.
```{r mutate, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=9}
experiment %>% 
    filter(TimeGroup=="100hr") %>%
    group_by(Treatment) %>%
    summarize(average.pH = mean(pH),
            stddev.pH = sd(pH)) %>%
    mutate(...)
```
```{r mutate-hint-1}
experiment %>% 
    filter(TimeGroup=="100hr") %>%
    group_by(Treatment) %>%
    summarize(average.pH = mean(pH),
            stddev.pH = sd(pH)) %>%
    mutate(low = ...,
           high = ...)
```
```{r mutate-hint-2}
experiment %>% 
    filter(TimeGroup=="100hr") %>%
    group_by(Treatment) %>%
    summarize(average.pH = mean(pH),
            stddev.pH = sd(pH)) %>%
    mutate(low = average.pH - 2*stddev.pH,
           high = ...)
```
```{r mutate-solution}
experiment %>% 
    filter(TimeGroup=="100hr") %>%
    group_by(Treatment) %>%
    summarize(average.pH = mean(pH),
            stddev.pH = sd(pH)) %>%
    mutate(low = average.pH - 2*stddev.pH,
           high = average.pH + 2*stddev.pH)
```

### Amazing!
The data frame we created over the three sections contains all the information we need to pass to `ggplot()` in order to create our visual.  In the next two sections, we will build our plot in stages.

Onward!






## Incrementally building our plot {data-progressive=TRUE}
Before continuing, it helps to save the summary data frame we created for plotting purposes.  The code below accomplishes this by adding a `-> plot_df` to the last line of the code. This essentially saves our work under the name `plot_df`, so that we can reference it later.
```
experiment %>% 
    filter(TimeGroup=="100hr") %>%
    group_by(Treatment) %>%
    summarize(average.pH = mean(pH),
            stddev.pH = sd(pH)) %>%
    mutate(low = average.pH - 2*stddev.pH,
           high = average.pH + 2*stddev.pH) -> plot_df
```

### Start the plot.
Equipped with `plot_df`, we are ready to start creating out plot.  As a brief reminder, remember our general syntax is 
```
ggplot(data = df_name, 
       aes(x = ..., y = ..., ...))
```
where 

* `df_name` is the data frame from which we pull our information
* `aes()` sets our global aesthetics^[By "global aesthetics," we mean aesthetics that will apply to all the geometries we use.], like `x` for our $x$-axis and `y` for our $y$-axis, and potentially more.

#### Exercise: setting up axes.
Complete the code below to link our plot to `plot_df`, and set the `x` and `y` aesthetics.  Remember we want the treatment group on the $x$-axis and the average pH on the $y$-axis.^[In science, it is convention for your independent variable to be on the $x$-axis, and the dependent variable to appear on the $y$-axis.]

```{r axes-setup, include = FALSE}
experiment %>% 
    filter(TimeGroup=="100hr") %>%
    group_by(Treatment) %>%
    summarize(average.pH = mean(pH),
            stddev.pH = sd(pH)) %>%
    mutate(low = average.pH - 2*stddev.pH,
           high = average.pH + 2*stddev.pH) -> plot_df
```

```{r axes, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=4}
ggplot(data = ...,
       aes(x = ...,
           y = ...))
```
```{r axes-hint-1}
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = ...,
           y = ...))
```
```{r axes-hint-2}
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = ...))
```
```{r axes-solution}
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH))
```

### Exercise: adding the first geometry
Now that the axes are set up, we can add our first geometry.  Remember that the bars in our sketch reflected the average pH of each Treatment group. Our $x$ and $y$ aesthetics are already set up, so we simply need to add the geometry.

In this case, we will use `geom_col()` as our geometry.^[The `geom_bar()` geometry also creates a bar plot, but it is designed specifically to work with categorical data and do aggregation automatically.] Add the code below!

```{r geom-bar, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=5, exercise.setup="axes-setup"}
# add the geometry to the code below
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) 
```
```{r geom-bar-hint-1}
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) +
    geom_...
```
```{r geom-bar-solution}
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) +
    geom_col()
```

### Adding error-bars
To show the variation within each treatment group, let's add the error-bars as prescribed by our `low` and `high` variables in `plot_df`. 
<!-- (Remember these represent (mean $\pm$ 2*std.dev) for the measurements within each group.) -->

The `geom_errorbar()` geometry requires some new aesthetics.  Since we have already set `x` when we created our axes, we need only specify two additional aesthetics to control where the error bars start and stop:  

* `ymin`: determines the bottom of the error bar (we will use `low` from `plot_df`)
* `ymax`: determines the top of the error bar (we will use `high` from `plot_df`)

We will also adjust the *width* of the error bars, because the default width is not always good.  We do this by adding `width = ...` outside of the aesthetics, but still inside the error-bar geometry.

#### Exercise. 
Add `geom_errobar(aes(...), width = ...)` to the plot below, and 

* assign the `ymin` and `ymax` aesthetics to the variables `low` and `high`, respectively; and
* provide a value of 0.1 for the width.

This should add nice-looking error bars to our plot.

```{r error-bars, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=6, exercise.setup="axes-setup"}
# add the errobar geometry and the aesthetics
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) +
    geom_col()
```
```{r error-bars-hint-1}
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) +
    geom_col()+
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=..., ymax =...), width = ...)
```
```{r error-bars-hint-2}
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) +
    geom_col()+
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=low, ymax =high), width = ...)
```
```{r error-bars-solution}
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) +
    geom_col()+
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=low, ymax =high), width = 0.1)
```


### Adding a *fill*-color by Treatment
Suppose we want some color in the plot; specifically, we would like each treatment group to be a different color.

Since the `fill` color will depend on the `Treatment` variable, this is a new aesthetic! As such, it must appear inside `aes()`. Since we are coloring the bars, we will place this aesthetic inside the `geom_col()` part of the plot.

```{r geom-color-bar, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=6, exercise.setup="axes-setup"}
# add the fill aesthetic to the code below
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) +
    geom_col(aes( ... ))+
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=low, ymax =high), width = 0.1)
```
```{r geom-color-bar-hint-1}
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill= ... ))+
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=low, ymax =high), width = 0.1)
```
```{r geom-color-bar-solution}
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill=Treatment))+
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=low, ymax =high), width = 0.1)
```

#### Great work!
We have an excellent working plot right now, and it looks even better than your co-author's drawing (no offense). There are a few tweaks, however, that might make it better.  In the last two sections, we apply some finishing touches!



## Minor modifications {data-progressive=TRUE}
Here is our plot so far
```{r fig.align='center',fig.width=5,fig.height=2.5}
experiment %>% 
    filter(TimeGroup=="100hr") %>%
    group_by(Treatment) %>%
    summarize(average.pH = mean(pH),
            stddev.pH = sd(pH)) %>%
    mutate(low = average.pH - 2*stddev.pH,
           high = average.pH + 2*stddev.pH) -> plot_df
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill=Treatment))+
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=low, ymax =high), width = 0.1)
```

We want to make three modifications:

1. We want better axis labels; specifically, we want the $y$-axis to be "Average pH". 
    * *Note:* figures in scientific reports do not have titles.
2. We want the $y$-axis to have markings for the first 8 units of pH (i.e., it should be labeled 0, 1, 2, ...7).
3. We want to re-order the Treatment groups on the $x$-axis so that `"wildtype"` appears first, followed by `"budB"` and then `"Control"`.

The first modification is straightforward, and simply involves adding `labs()` to the plot with arguments for `y`.  The second, involves *scaling* one of our aesthetics, namely `y`, which we can accomplish with `scale_y_continuous()`, since pH is measured on a continuous scale. 

Our third modification is the most involved, but we will walk through it in our final section.

### Changing axis labels

Let's take care of our $y$-axis label first. Run the code below to see what it does, and then modify the code to provide the appropriate label.
```{r labels, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=8, exercise.setup="axes-setup"}
# add the fill aesthetic to the code below
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) +
    geom_col(aes( fill=Treatment ))+
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=low, ymax =high), width = 0.1)+
    labs(y="new y axis")
```

```{r labels-solution}
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) +
    geom_col(aes( fill=Treatment ))+
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=low, ymax =high), width = 0.1)+
    labs(y="Average pH")
```

### Scaling the $y$-axis
When scaling a continuous aesthetic, like `y` which records pH, we use the following
```
scale_y_continuous(breaks = vector_of_labels)
```
The `breaks` argument allows us to choose which labels we want to appear on the axis. However, we do need to provide these as a vector of numbers.  To accomplish this, I recommend using the `seq()` function.  Run the code below to get a sense of how it works.
```{r sequence, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=2}
seq(0, 7, by = 0.5)
```
*What code would give us a vector containing 0, 1, 2, ..., 7?* Use the code-chunk above to figure this out, because you will need it in the next exercise!

#### Exercise: adding $y$-axis labels.
For our last exercise, add the `scale_y_continuous(breaks=...)` code to the plot. Fill in the `...` with the appropriate code to generate a our labels from 0 to 7.
```{r scale-y, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=9, exercise.setup="axes-setup"}
# add the fill aesthetic to the code below
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) +
    geom_col(aes( fill=Treatment ))+
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=low, ymax =high), width = 0.1)+
    labs(y="Average pH")
```
```{r scale-y-hint-1}
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill= fill=Treatment ))+
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=low, ymax =high), width = 0.1)+
    labs(y="Average pH")+
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = ...)
```
```{r scale-y-hint-2}
ggplot(data = plot_df,
       aes(x = Treatment,

#### Keep at it!
We're almost done. In our final section, we learn how to adjust the order of our $x$-axis labels! 

## Re-ordering the $x$-axis
Changing the order in which the $x$-axis labels appear involves *redefining* the `Treatment` variable and specifying your desired order for the groups.  We can use the `factor()` command to accomplish this. 

<details>
<summary> $\blacktriangleright$ Optional information on *factors*.</summary>
A *factor* is actually a "data type" in `R`; in other words, it's a specific way to store data.  The factor data type was designed with the purpose of working with categorical variables, like `Treatment`, and this is often how categorical data is stored in `R`.  The fact that we can *order the levels* of a factor is one feature that makes it ideal for this kind of work. 
</details>

### A simple example
To explore how it works, consider the example where we have a vector called `birthdays` which stores the months in which some survey participants were born. To keep it simple, let's assume we only have three months in our data: `"Jan"`, `"Feb"`, or `"Mar"`.

```{r echo = TRUE}
birthdays
```

In `R` we want to store this as a factor variable so that we can impose a very specific order to the months: 

<center> `"Jan"`, `"Feb"`, `"Mar"`.</center> <br>

(*Note*: The default ordering would be alphabetical, which is nonsense when you look at it in a plot.)

To impose this order, we would use the following command
```{r echo = TRUE}
factor(birthdays,
        levels = c("Jan","Feb","Mar"))
```

Notice that in the output our colors appear in the desired order: `### Levels: Jan Feb Mar`.

#### Exercise!
We can define *any order* we want. Following the syntax above, create a factor variable from `birthdays` but with the levels ordered as `"Mar"`, `"Feb"`, `"Jan"`, like we are moving backward in time.

```{r relevel-ex, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=4}
factor(...,
       levels = ...)
```
```{r relevel-ex-hint-1}
factor(birthdays,
       levels = ...)
```
```{r relevel-ex-hint-2}
factor(birthdays,
       levels = c("...","...","..."))
```
```{r relevel-ex-solution}
factor(birthdays,
       levels = c("Mar","Feb","Jan"))
```

### Modifying the `Treatment` variable
To change the order of the `Treatment` groups on the $x$-axis, we actually have to modify the `Treatment` variable and re-assign an order for its levels (`"wildtype"`, `"budB"`,`"Control"`).

A quick way to re-assign the order of our treatment groups is to use `mutate()` to *recreate* the `Treatment` variable, and use `factor()` to set a specific order, as we did above for `birthdays`.

Consider the code below: 

```
plot_df %>%
    mutate(Treatment = factor(Treatment,
                              levels = ...)
           ) -> plot_df2

levels(plot_df2$Treatment)
```

* We start with `plot_df` and use `mutate()` to change the `Treatment` variable.
* Inside the mutate command, we reassign `Treatment` to a new factor variable using the `factor()` command.  *We have left these details for you to complete soon!*
* Notice `-> plot_df2` appears after the mutate command; this stores the *newly ordered* plotting data as `plot_df2`.
* The last line of the provided code, `levels(plot_df2$Treatment)`, shows us the levels of the new `Treatment` variable in `plot_df2`. This allows us to check the new ordering.

#### Exercise!
Remembering that we want our labels to read `"wildtype"`, `"budB"`, then `"Control"`, complete the code below to re-order the levels of the `Treatment` variable. 


```{r relevel-plot-df, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=8,exercise.setup="axes-setup"}
plot_df %>%
    mutate(Treatment = factor(Treatment,
                              levels = ...)
           ) -> plot_df2

levels(plot_df2$Treatment)
```
```{r relevel-plot-df-hint-1}
plot_df %>%
    mutate(Treatment = factor(Treatment,
                              levels = c("...",
                                         "...",
                                         "...")
                              )) -> plot_df2

levels(plot_df2$Treatment)
```
```{r relevel-plot-df-solution}
plot_df %>%
    mutate(Treatment = factor(Treatment,
                              levels = c("wildtype",
                                         "budB",
                                         "Control")
                              )) -> plot_df2

levels(plot_df2$Treatment)
```
**Answer check:** Did the output of `levels(plot_df2$Treatment)` put the groups in the desired order?

To create our plot with the new order on the $x$-axis, just need to use `plot_df2` in the code we already generated.  Below we copied an pasted our ggplot-code already.  

#### Exercise!
Change the name of the data frame to `plot_df2` and see if the $x$-axis now appears in the correct order!

```{r plot-df2, include =FALSE}
experiment %>% 
    filter(TimeGroup=="100hr") %>%
    group_by(Treatment) %>%
    summarize(average.pH = mean(pH),
            stddev.pH = sd(pH)) %>%
    mutate(low = average.pH - 2*stddev.pH,
           high = average.pH + 2*stddev.pH) -> plot_df

plot_df %>% mutate(Treatment = factor(Treatment,
                              levels = c("wildtype",
                                         "budB",
                                         "Control")))->plot_df2
```

```{r final-plot, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=9,exercise.setup="plot-df2"}
ggplot(data = ...,  #<---- set the updated data frame!
       aes(x = Treatment,
           y = average.pH)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill=Treatment))+
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=low, ymax =high), width = 0.1)+
    labs(y="Average pH")+
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,7,by = 1))
```

#### Some Quick Notes
* Ideally, we would have re-ordered the levels of `Treatment` during the "Preparing a plotting data frame" step of the process. But making plots is not always a linear process.  Now that we're aware of the work involved in re-ordering our $x$-axis though, we recommend choosing an order ahead of time and including this code in the step where you prepare your data for the plot.
* There are other ways of re-ordering the levels of a factor variable.  Since `ggplot2` is part of the tidyverse, we recommend learning about the `fct_relevel()` command in the [`forcats` package](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_relevel.html).
